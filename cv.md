## About me

> Frontend Developer with 2 years of work experience as Web Developer in small local studio.

I enjoy making web applications. Always learning new things but not forgetting about fundamentals. \
Currently my main focus is on `JavaScript` and Frontend development in general. \
I am also learning about Backend development and `Ruby` and `Ruby on Rails` to get more thorough understanding about how the Web works and get a taste of a different language.
